# BinarySearch
A program to find an element in an array using a binary search
algorithm.  Take in user input for:

1. The size of the array,
2. The elements in the array,
3. A value that is to be searched for. If the value is found, return
   its index (0-based). If it is not found, return "not found."

Assume the array contains positive integers in increasing order but
not necessarily consecutive.

Examples of input/output:

1.
Enter number of elements in array: 5
Enter 5 integers and the element to be searched: 22 33 44 55 66 33
value 33 found at index 1

2.
Enter number of elements in array: 5
Enter 5 integers and the element to be searched: 22 33 44 55 66 123
value 123 not found
